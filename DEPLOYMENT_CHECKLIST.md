## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Test signup with new account
- [ ] Test login with existing account
- [ ] Create a chat message
- [ ] Add a todo item
- [ ] Generate a timetable
- [ ] Create a flashcard

- [ ] Configure deploy previews for pull requests

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build fails on Netlify
**Solution**: Check Node.js version
- Add `.nvmrc` file with version: `18`
- Or set in Netlify: Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment > NODE_VERSION = 18

### Issue: Routes return 404
**Solution**: Verify `_redirects` file
- Check file exists in build output
- Content should be: `/*    /index.html   200`

### Issue: Firebase connection fails
**Solution**: Check environment variables
- Verify production config in `environment.prod.ts`
- Ensure all Firebase keys are correct

### Issue: Firestore permission denied
**Solution**: Update security rules
- Check rules allow authenticated users
- Verify userId matching in rules
