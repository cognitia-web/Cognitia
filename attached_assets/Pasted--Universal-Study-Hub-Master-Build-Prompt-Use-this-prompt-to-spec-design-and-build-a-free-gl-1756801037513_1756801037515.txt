# Universal Study Hub — Master Build Prompt

Use this prompt to spec, design, and build a free, globally accessible study platform for students. Keep the tone future‑refined, simple, and minimal with subtle motion.

## Product North Star

A free, global study hub that helps any student learn faster with AI flashcards, long‑answer Q\&A, spaced‑repetition revision, task‑based timetables, and a consistency reward ladder from **Bronze → Energon**.

## Key Outcomes

* Students actually study daily (gated progress until they add today’s task).
* Measurable recall improvement via smart revision intervals.
* Delightful, low‑friction UX that runs on free hosting tiers.

## Primary Personas

* **School Student (13–18)**: needs structure, fast answers, bite‑size revision.
* **College Student (18–24)**: needs long‑form Q\&A, custom schedules, depth.

## Core Feature Set (Must‑Have)

1. **Auth**: Sign up / Login (email + OAuth options). First‑login flow requires adding today’s task before any other page is accessible.
2. **Task Gate**: After login each day, the user must create at least **one task for today** (title, subject, estimate, intensity). Until then, all other pages are **locked** (blurred/disabled) except Settings and Help.
3. **AI Flashcard Reader**

   * Input sources: typed text, PDF/URL upload (extract text), and notes.
   * Auto‑generate flashcards (Q/A pairs) with choices and short answers.
   * Study modes: Learn, Review, Shuffle, Leitner boxes.
   * Memory tracking + streaks; export/import card decks (JSON/CSV).
4. **AI Q\&A (Short + Long Answers)**

   * Ask any question; choose **AI model** (dropdown of available models).
   * Modes: *Concise*, *Explain like I’m 15*, *Exam‑Style Long Answer*.
   * Citations when sources are provided; outline + final answer; plagiarism‑safe rephrasing.
5. **To‑Do + Task‑Based Timetable**

   * Create tasks with **Intensity** (Low/Medium/High) and **Effort (min)**.
   * Auto‑block schedule based on available hours and intensity preference.
   * Drag‑to‑reschedule, one‑tap “done”, partial‑complete slider.
6. **Smart Revision Timetable (Never‑Forget Engine)**

   * Spaced repetition planner that computes **next review days** per topic.
   * Default spacing: Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 120 (editable); track recall quality (Again/Hard/Good/Easy) to stretch/shrink intervals.
   * Calendar view + notifications; “catch‑up” suggestions when overdue.
7. **Rewards & Levels (Bronze → Energon)**

   * **Point economy**:

     * Stage 1: 100 pts (Bronze) → unlock basic badge.
     * Stage 2: 250 pts (Silver) → unlock profile ring.
     * Stage 3: 500 pts (Gold) → unlock theme accent.
     * After Stage 3, **each new level = +1000 pts**.
   * Suggested ladder: **Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond → Obsidian → Titanium → Quantum → Omega → Energon**.
   * Earn points for: tasks completed, revision sessions, streak days, flashcard sets mastered, helpful community answers (future).
   * Streak freeze (1/day), gentle decay after 3 missed days.
8. **Daily Discipline Quote**

   * On Home screen: automatically fetch and display **one discipline‑themed quote per day** from the internet; cache for 24h with source attribution.
9. **Model Picker**

   * Allow user to choose AI model per feature (Flashcards/Q\&A) with a fallback if quota exceeded. Persist per user.
10. **Free Hosting Target**

* Build to run within free tiers for hosting, DB, and inference proxying where possible (lightweight, client‑heavy rendering, serverless functions).

## Secondary Features (Nice‑to‑Have)

* Subject templates (Math/Science/Humanities) for quick task creation.
* Import from Google Drive/Notion.
* Community deck sharing with moderation queue.

## Core Pages & States

1. **Auth**: Sign up, Login, Forgot password.
2. **Task Gate (Daily)**: Minimal screen prompting “Add your first task for today to unlock the app.” CTA opens Task modal. Until created, all nav items are disabled.
3. **Home**: Streak, today’s tasks, next revisions, **Daily Discipline Quote**, quick start (Ask AI, Add Flashcards).
4. **Study → Flashcards**: Deck list, deck detail, study session, stats.
5. **Study → Q\&A**: Prompt box, model picker, response with outline → long answer; copy, save, export.
6. **Planner → To‑Do**: Task CRUD, intensity, estimates, tags, sort/filter.
7. **Planner → Timetable**: Auto‑scheduled blocks; drag & drop; focus mode.
8. **Planner → Revision**: Calendar of spaced intervals; overdue queue; “snooze/complete”.
9. **Rewards**: Level meter, points history, badges, streak controls.
10. **Settings**: Model defaults, theme, notifications, data export, privacy.

## Flows (Critical)

* **First‑Day Flow**: Login → Task Gate → Add Task → App unlocks → Onboarding tooltips.
* **Daily Flow**: Login (new day) → Task Gate check → Add/confirm today’s task → Study or Plan.
* **Q\&A Flow**: Enter question → pick model → choose mode → get outline → approve → long answer → save to notes or flashcards.
* **Flashcard Flow**: Import notes/PDF → AI generates deck → user edits → study with spaced repetition → points awarded based on accuracy + time.
* **Revision Flow**: Topic graded after session → schedule recalculated → next date set.

## Gamification Rules (Detailed)

* **Point Sources** (suggested):

  * Complete a task: 25–75 pts depending on intensity + duration.
  * Finish a revision session: 100 pts.
  * Maintain daily streak: +25, +50, +75… escalating weekly.
  * Master a deck (≥90% correct): 250 pts.
* **Level Thresholds**:

  * L1 **Bronze** – 100
  * L2 **Silver** – 250
  * L3 **Gold** – 500
  * L4 **Platinum** – 1,500
  * L5 **Diamond** – 2,500
  * L6 **Obsidian** – 3,500
  * L7 **Titanium** – 4,500
  * L8 **Quantum** – 5,500
  * L9 **Omega** – 6,500
  * L10 **Energon** – 7,500
* Show progress bar with remaining points; confetti pulse on leveling.

## UI/UX Style Guide

* **Theme**: “Refined future.” Clean whites/darks, generous whitespace, 12/20/28px type scale.
* **Motion**: Subtle micro‑interactions (hover lifts, 150–200ms ease).
* **Components**: Cards with 2xl radius, soft shadows, minimal borders.
* **Empty States**: Friendly, 1‑line guidance + primary CTA.
* **Accessibility**: WCAG AA contrast, keyboard nav, reduced motion option.

## Technical Notes (suggested, vendor‑agnostic)

* **Frontend**: SPA/MPA with code‑split routes; PWA for offline study sessions.
* **Backend**: Serverless functions for auth, quote fetcher, scheduling, and points.
* **DB**: Hosted serverless DB with generous free tier.
* **AI**: Pluggable provider interface; model registry + per‑user default.
* **Scheduling**: Deterministic spaced‑rep engine; daily cron to enqueue reminders.
* **Caching**: 24h cache for daily quote; client‑first render with ISR where possible.

## Data Model (high level)

* **User**(id, name, email, streak, level, points, modelDefaults, settings)
* **Task**(id, userId, title, subject, intensity, estimateMin, date, status)
* **Deck**(id, userId, title, source, cards\[], stats)
* **QA**(id, userId, prompt, mode, model, answer, savedAt)
* **RevisionTopic**(id, userId, title, nextDate, intervalDays, ease, history\[])
* **PointsEvent**(id, userId, type, amount, meta, createdAt)
* **Quote**(id, text, author, sourceUrl, dayKey)

## Guardrails & Policies

* **Daily Gate**: Block navigation if no **today task** exists; show persistent banner with “Add today’s task to continue.”
* **Academic Integrity**: Encourage learning; add “understand vs copy” warnings; provide citation tools.
* **Privacy**: Clear policy; export/delete data; analytics opt‑in only.

## Success Metrics

* Daily Active Users
* Avg. Tasks Created/Day
* 7‑day Streak %, Revision Completion %
* Time‑to‑Answer (Q\&A), Deck Mastery Rate

## Acceptance Criteria (Done = ✅)

* Users cannot access main app without adding today’s task.
* AI flashcards + Q\&A (incl. long answers) work with model picker.
* Spaced repetition computes next dates and updates after grading.
* Rewards ladder and points accumulate exactly as specified.
* Daily discipline quote loads and caches with attribution.
* Minimal, future‑refined UI with subtle animations.
