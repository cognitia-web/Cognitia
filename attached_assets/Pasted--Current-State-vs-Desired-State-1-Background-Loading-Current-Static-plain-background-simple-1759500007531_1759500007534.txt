🔍 Current State vs. Desired State
1. Background & Loading

Current: Static plain background, simple load.

Desired:

A dynamic animated background like izum.study
 with soft gradients, particles, or fluid motion.

Custom loading animation with Cognitia’s logo animating smoothly (like a living organism or glowing brain), not just a spinner.

2. Hero Section

Current: Simple heading and sectioning.

Desired:

A bold, oversized headline with strong hierarchy (clear message in <3 seconds).

A slideshow/carousel like merise.ae
 with smooth cinematic transitions.

CTAs with interactive hover states (color shift, glow, slide animation).

3. Navigation

Current: Standard nav bar.

Desired:

A floating vertical nav bar on the left like c-screens.tv
.

Compact icon-only default, expands on hover to reveal labels.

Smooth easing animations, glassmorphism or subtle glow effect.

4. Goal List & Content

Current: Simple sections without personality.

Desired:

A goal list experience like bravepeople.co
.

Interactive checklist with animations: checkmarks flip, progress bars fill, goals “glow” when completed.

Dynamic, user-friendly storytelling of Cognitia’s mission.

5. Footer

Current: Minimal, almost placeholder.

Desired:

A structured, beautiful footer like guildmind.app
.

Include: product links, social icons, newsletter subscription, brand slogan.

Styled as an extension of the brand, not an afterthought.

6. Micro-Interactions & Buttons

Current: Standard click responses, minimal hover.

Desired:

On click, buttons rotate 360°. At 180° rotation, the icon swaps (e.g., sun ↔ moon, heart ↔ check).

This action triggers a theme change: site colors shift like a sunrise/sunset transition.

Links get smooth underline animations, cards scale with soft shadows on hover, scroll-based fades/slides for storytelling.

7. Branding & Personality

Current: Feels like an MVP template.

Desired:

Unique Cognitia brand palette: intelligent, futuristic, growth-oriented (deep blues, glowing neons, or warm gradients).

Typography with clear hierarchy — bold modern font for headers, readable sans-serif for body.

Consistent motion language: every action should feel connected to intelligence, growth, and clarity.

8. Accessibility & Performance

Current: Basic responsiveness.

Desired:

High contrast for text, proper ARIA roles for navigation.

Smooth across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Optimize animations for 60 FPS without lag.

🎯 The Ask

Rebuild Cognitia (https://cognitia-glow-up.lovable.app/
) into the best website in the world, following all instructions above with pixel-perfect precision. Every improvement must be executed thoughtfully, balancing elegance, intelligence, and delight.

This is not optional polish — it’s transformation. The site must feel premium, alive, futuristic, and unforgettable.
